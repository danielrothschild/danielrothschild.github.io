Squib  guidance
============

The sole requirement for this course is to write a short paper on some topic of interest.  The idea of the paper will be to take up one particular point in the literature (or in the formal systems discussed) and provide a brief analysis of what is going, presenting a problem and, perhaps a solution to that problem.  One thing you can do is write about an issue raised (but not resolved) in the lecture notes or the problem set.  Another is to take an issue raised in some of the reading and write about it.  Your discussion should be precise and relate---in some way---to the technical summary and the formalism of dynamic semantics, though you may choose to discuss more philosophical issues. Below are some sample topics you might discuss.



Ideal topic for a squib
----
Come up with your own examples/argument for one approach or another. Or just something that is problematic for all analyses.  If you speak a language other than English you might discuss how pronouns/presupposition/epistemic modals work in that language and whether that can be accounted for by any of the theories we have discussed.


More semantic:
----

- Discuss the relationship between dynamic semantics and [Jeff King's context dependent quantifier approach](semantics.uchicago.edu/workshops/spl/anaphora/king05.pdf).

- What is the *proportion problem* and what resolution(s) of it is possible in dynamic semantics? 

- Is there a reasonable resolution of the *problem of indistiguishable participants* for the e-type theory.

- Is presupposition projection symmetric?  Can this be accounted for in dynamics semantics.  (Here you might look at [my paper](http://danielrothschild.com/rothschild-explaining.pdf), which you should feel free to disagree with.)

- Should we think of adverbs of quantification as quantifying over situations or assignment functions?  

- Evaluate the explanatory challenge that Heim (1990), Schlenker and [Rothschild](http://danielrothschild.com/rothschild-explaining.pdf) push against Heim's theory of presupposition projection.

- For plain inter-sentential anaphora, is there any clear advantage to a dynamic account over an e-type account?  (Think about uniqueness implication, and Evans' example of Welsh doctor discussed in my notes and in Heim's dissertation)

- What is a decent semantic entry for `or' in a dynamic approach? (Is there one possible?)

- The following two examples are due to Barbara Partee.  What kind of account do they support?

(@) 9 of 10 marbles are on the table.  ? It's under the chair. 

(@) Either there is no bathroom, or it's under the stairs.  

- Does the dynamic semantics given in the technical summary provide an adequate account of epistemic modals embedded under  quantifiers in examples such as this:

(@) Everyone inside might be outside. (See [Yalcin](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14251569/Published/Yalcin%202015%20epistemic-modality-de-re.pdf))

- Issue coming from problem set: is there a good reason to have *partial* assignment functions in our representation of content, or can we just use sets of world-assignment function pairs.

- Is Coopers e-type theory (as discussed by Heim) really doomed?  Are her arguments against it convincing? (See her discussion of the *formal link* in the e-type paper).
   
More philosophical:
----

- Does dynamic semantics collapse the distinction between semantic value and conversational update? Should that distinction be collapsed? (The answer, incidentally, is no and no)

- Does the dynamic tradition/Yalcin give convincing arguments that sentences with epistemic modals sometimes do not express propositions.  For reference with Yalcin you might look at my ['equivalence proof'](http://danielrothschild.com/dyncon/vy/) as well as his [original paper](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14251569/Published/Yalcin%202007%20Epistemic%20modals.pdf).

- Examine the arguments that Schlenker gives in [Local contexts](semprag.org/article/viewFile/sp.2.3/71) against Stalnaker's account of presupposition projection.  Are they legitimate?

- Should there even be a formal theory presupposition projection.  For a 'no' answer see Stalnaker's recent book *Context*, where he criticizes Schlenker (and even me).

- Does [Lewis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/51jo3llkze2vtw6/Indefinites_revised.pdf) give an effective critique of dynamic semantics?  

- Is Lewis's suggestion that we should adopt Heim's notion of file cards without embracing dynamic semantics, tenable?

- Evaluate an argument in [Stalnaker's](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40180108) paper on context.
