Abstract: Noise is normally regarded as a challenge for effective communication. In this talk, I will consider an alternative perspective on noise: under certain conditions, it can allow speakers to communicate more effectively than would be possible in its absence. I will use this idea to provide a pragmatic account of the interpretive effects of focus, as in 3) and 4):<br />
3) ALICE went to the store.<br />
4) Bob only introduced BILL to Sue.<br />
Traditional accounts (Rooth, 1985, 1992; von Stechow, 1990; Krifka, 1992) interpret focus by augmenting the semantics, e.g., by recursively computing a set of alternatives. Under the proposed account, focus itself does not have any semantic content. Instead, it reduces the noise rate on a portion of the utterance. The interpretive effects of focus arise from recursive pragmatic reasoning about this noise reduction, with the listener trying to infer the speaker‚Äôs motives for this reduction, and the speaker exploiting this reasoning. This approach derives many of the interpretive effects of focus, including exhaustification, association with focus, contrastive stress, intensification, and others. The detailed derivations expose the different types of commonsense reasoning that underly these different interpretive effects.</p>
