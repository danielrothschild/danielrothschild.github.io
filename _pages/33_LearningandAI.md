<div class="title"> ABOUT </div>

The remarkable recent advances in AI are powered by learning algorithms that allow computers to develop  abilities through training. Unlike traditional programming, where software is explicitly coded with specific instructions, modern AI systems <i> learn </i> through experience, adapting and improving their performance as they process vast amounts of data. This module uses machine learning as a window into the more familiar, but still largely mysterious, process of human learning. We will read and discuss classical and contemporary literature from a variety of disciplines including philosophy, computer science, psychology, and evolutionary biology on learning and cognition.

<div class="title"> MECHANICS </div>

The seminar meets Thursdays from 2pm to 5pm in the seminar room of the UCL Philosophy Department, 19 Gordon Square.  There is no meeting on 30 May. On 6 June the seminar will meet from 11-1pm in order not to clash with the Shearman Lectues (Nico Kolodny) and the last session will be 13 June.

The module will be assessed by a 3500-word essay.
