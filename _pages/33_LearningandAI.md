<div class="title"> ABOUT </div>

The remarkable recent advances in AI are powered by learning algorithms that allow computers to develop  abilities through training. Unlike traditional programming, where software is explicitly coded with specific instructions, modern AI systems <i> learn </i> through experience, adapting and improving their performance as they process vast amounts of data. This module uses machine learning as a window into the the more familiar, but still largely unknown, process of human learning. We will read and discuss classical and contemporary literature from a variety of displines including philosophy, computer science, psychology, and evolutionary biology on learning and cognition.

<div class="title"> MECHANICS </div>

The seminar meets Thursdays from 2pm to 5pm in the seminar room of the UCL Philosophy Department, 19 Gordon Square.  There is no meeting on 30 May. One extra session will be scheduled later down the road to accomodate everyone's schedule.

The module will be assessed by a 3500-word essay.

Auditors very welcome!
