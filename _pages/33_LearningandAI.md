<div class="title"> ABOUT </div>

This class will use recent advances in AI as a foil to examine what we know and what we don't know about human learning. Readings will be by cognitive scientists, philosophers, journalists, and LLMs.

<div class="title"> MECHANICS </div>

The seminar meets Thursdays from 2pm to 5pm in the seminar room of the UCL Philosophy Department, 19 Gordon Square.  There is no meeting on 30 May. One extra session will be scheduled later.

The module will be assessed by a 3500-word essay.

Auditors very welcome!
