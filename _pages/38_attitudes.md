<div class="title"> ABOUT </div>

This seminar will focus on the semantics of propositional attitudes reports, such as 'Mary thought that Vanessa was sick'. We will begin by examining the basic question of what attitudes ascriptions are, syntactically and semantically.  On the traditional view they express a relationship between an individual thinker and an object, a proposition. We will explore alternatives to this view.   We will move on to discuss other attitudes ascriptions such as desire ascriptions.
