##### WORLDS, SENTENCES AND MEASURES (PHIL0129)

<div class="title"> ABOUT </div>

The goal of WSM is to introduce graduate students and advanced undergraduates to some of the basic formal methods used by philosophers. We cover such topics as set theory, modal logic and probability theory.  While all students are expected to be familiar with predicate logic, I expect a considerable diversity in background and mathematical maturity. The goal of the course is to equip students with the ability to be able to read and engage with papers in the contemporary literature that rely on formal arguments and methods.


<div class="title"> INSTRUCTORS </div>

Daniel Rothschild is the module leader and Tom Williams is the PGTA.

<div class="title"> TIME AND LOCATION </div>

Term 1, Thursdays 10am-12pm, Gordon Square 102.

<div class="title"> PRACTICAL INFORMATION </div>

*All our welcome as auditors* and should feel free to come to any sessions (and may pick and choose according to interest).

There will be weekly problem sets  (9 in total), on which collaboration is encouraged.  For undergraduates there is a final exam (Problem sets are worth 60% and exam is worth 40%.)  Graduate students are not graded by exam but are required to answer more, and more difficult, problems.


<div class="title"> READINGS </div>

Readings will be provided on moodle with the exception of the one textbook, [Sider, Logic for Philosophy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Logic-Philosophy-Theodore-Sider/dp/0199575584)

John Burgess's book [Philosophical Logic](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philosophical-Princeton-Foundations-Contemporary-Philosophy/dp/0691156336), covers some of the topics covered in the course.
