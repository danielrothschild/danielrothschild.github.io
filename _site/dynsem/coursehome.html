<h1 id="dynamic-semantics-and-pragmatics">Dynamic Semantics and Pragmatics</h1>
<p>a.k.a. Graduate Studies in Philosophy of Language</p>
<p><a href="http://danielrothschild.com/">Daniel Rothschild</a></p>
<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>This is a graduate course in philosophy of language. Our focus will be on the program in semantics called <em>dynamic semantics</em>. Understanding dynamic semantics requires looking at foundational issues in philosophy of language, such as the following: what is the distinction between semantics and pragmatics, what are semantic values, and what is the role of propositions in communication? We will keep our eye on these questions as we explore some of the main ideas both theoretical and empirical in the program of dynamic semantics.</p>
<h4 id="practical-information">Practical information:</h4>
<p>All our welcome in this course as auditors and should feel free to come to any sessions (and may pick and choose according to interest). Enrolled students will be required to submit a short paper (what linguists call a squib), on some topic related to the course.</p>
<h4 id="time-and-place">Time and place:</h4>
<p>Fridays 2-4PM, seminar room, first floor, 19 Gordon Square. The sessions will follow the standard UCL Academic calendar, running from Friday 7 October 2016 to Friday, 16 December 2016 (note <em>no session during reading week on 11 November</em>)</p>
<h4 id="readings">Readings</h4>
<p>Readings will be available online, if not linked below, but you must email me (Daniel) for access.</p>

<p>This is over-ambitious and subject to change if we get stuck in a process.</p>
